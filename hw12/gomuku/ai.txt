1.  Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., 
    do something more clever than just pick a random legal move?
    My AI makes moves randomly. To make it smarter,
    I should enhance the logic of the AI to evaluate
    the game state and select moves based on certain strategies.

2.  How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm.
    MMy AI uses random moves. It randomly selects a position to place its piece.
    To improve this, I need to implement more sophisticated algorithms.

3.  How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?
    Almost every time human can win the game.

4.  How easy would it be to make the difficulty level adjustable?
    Difficulty level adjustment is not currently implemented.

5.  How would you improve it in the future?
    It is very easy for human to win the game.
    Therefore, I think the computer's move should be more sophisticated to beat the human.
